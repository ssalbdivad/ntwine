// ---- THE ONE-OFF TIMER (scheduler SOURCE 6) ------------------------------------------------------
// A worker's own alarm clock: text handed back at ONE instant, once. These drive the REAL scheduler
// pass over REAL storage with only the tailer stubbed (it is the input being varied) and `now`
// injected, exactly as the recurring-prompt tests do.
//
// The three properties worth pinning, because each is a deliberate DIFFERENCE from a sibling source:
//   - it fires MID-TURN (the heartbeat's gate, not the snooze's) — a promise for 15:00 kept at 15:50 is
//     not the feature that was asked for;
//   - it fires EXACTLY ONCE, and the guarantee lives on the row (`state`), not on the outbox, whose
//     terminal rows are pruned past a cap;
//   - a thread may hold MANY, which is why they are a table at all.
