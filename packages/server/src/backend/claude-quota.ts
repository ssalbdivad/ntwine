// Subscription quota is read from the OAuth usage endpoint — the same call Claude Code's own /usage
// command makes — authorized by the credential already on this machine (the on-disk
// ~/.claude/.credentials.json, or the macOS login Keychain). That is one ~200ms HTTPS GET, immune to
// local CPU load.
//
// It is not the only source. Claude Code can be signed in by routes that leave no token in either
// place: a token in its environment, or a proxy in front of the API that adds the sign-in to every
// request (a "token broker"). With no token to read, the request goes the way Claude Code was told to
// send its own — see ConfiguredRoute. And the endpoint refuses and rate-limits like any other, so what
// the account's own sessions report on every turn is laid over whatever this returns — see
// readClaudeQuota at the bottom, and claude-quota-observed.ts for where those reports come from.
//
// `claude -p /usage` IS A WHOLE CLAUDE CODE PROCESS, AND IT STARTS FOR EXACTLY ONE REASON: a
// credential exists and the endpoint rejected it (401/403). Claude Code owns OAuth refresh and
// rotation, so it is the only thing that can turn an expired token back into a working one. Every
// other failure — no credential at all, the network down, a timeout, a 5xx, a malformed body — fails
// the refresh and starts nothing, because the CLI makes this same request with this same credential
// and fails the same way. Until 2026-10-11 all of those fell through to the CLI and nothing
// remembered that it had failed, so a machine that was not signed in to Claude started a Claude Code
// process on every refresh attempt, for as long as ntwine ran (maintainer: "That's fucking nuts. We
// can't do that."). Measured that day: a real signed-out server with an empty board started one every
// 30s off the heartbeat alone, and with a chip polling every 15s beside it the same reader started
// 362 in a simulated hour — six a minute. Offline and a dead credential cost the same. The one start
// that remains is bounded by a persisted backoff — see CLI_BACKOFF_BASE_MS.
//
// (Spawning Claude Code was once the PRIMARY path, and under heavy machine load — worker fleets
// pushing load-80+ — it reliably exceeded any sane exec timeout: every refresh died and the chip
// served the same stale reading for hours.)

// proves nothing about the token this reader holds. A refresh that worked buys hours of valid token,
