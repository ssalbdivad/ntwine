/**
 * WHERE A LAUNCH LANDS — the rules about folders, kept where a server release can change them.
 *
 * `frizz` typed in a folder is a question: is this a project Frizz knows, one to offer, or neither?
 * The launcher answered it itself until this module, from its own bundled copy of the registry and
 * project-root code, so every change to the answer needed a `frizz` shell release — four of the
 * seven between 2026-10-01 and 2026-10-11, at hours each in npm's review — while the same rule in a
 * running server had changed minutes after it landed. The launcher now ASKS the running server
 * (`POST /_frizz/control/launch`, app.ts) and keeps its own copy only for a server that predates the
 * route. plans/server-side-launch-routing.md has the whole design.
